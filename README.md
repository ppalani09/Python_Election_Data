# Python_Election_Data
Data Science Bootcamp - HW #3 - Python HW

I've created a Python script for summarizing election results based on voting records. The dataset is composed of three columns: voter ID, county, and candidate vote. The script produces the following outputs:

  The total number of votes cast


  A complete list of candidates who received votes


  The percentage of votes each candidate won


  The total number of votes each candidate won


  The winner of the election based on popular vote.
